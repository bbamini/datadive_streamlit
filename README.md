## Streamlit app

This app was drafted to support the Datakind virtual DataDive event with the International Monetary Fund. The app here provides a template for visualizations for South Africa and Mozambique. It includes a census of buildings and historic storms. 

To run the app:
``` 
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Alternatively, app is also available [here](https://datadive-imf-climate-draft.streamlit.app/)
